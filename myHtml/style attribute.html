<h2>The style Attribute</h2>
<p>The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color:</p>

<p style="color:blue;">This is a red paragraph, we can write anything here </p>
                 red
				 green
   <!--here we use any color with ";" (nearly 140 colors in there)  -->  
</body>
</html>






<!--The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.
